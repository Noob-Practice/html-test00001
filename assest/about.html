      We are a educational institution that operates independently of government
      funding and control. These schools are typically funded through tuition
      fees, donations, and private grants, which allows them to offer a
      curriculum and set of policies that may differ from public schools.
      Private schools often have smaller class sizes, which can result in more
      personalized attention for students and closer teacher-student
      relationships. Many private schools emphasize academic excellence and may
      offer specialized programs such as advanced placement (AP) courses,
      International Baccalaureate (IB) programs, or focus on specific
      educational philosophies like Montessori or Waldorf. Extracurricular
      activities, including sports, arts, and music programs, are usually a key
      part of their offerings, helping to promote a well-rounded education.
      Private schools can be secular or religiously affiliated, with the latter
      incorporating faith-based teachings into their curriculum. Admission
      processes often involve entrance exams, interviews, and evaluations of
      previous academic performance, making them more selective than public
      schools. While they tend to offer a high standard of education, the cost
      can be prohibitive for some families, which is why many private schools
      offer financial aid or scholarships to help students from diverse
      backgrounds.
